    <h2>Getting your Game patched</h2>
    <p>
        Congratulations on acquiring your movable.sed and dsiware.bin!<br/>
        You will now patch your game to allow for the core exploit to be executed, which will allow you to install
        CFW.<br/>
        Hold both files ready, you will need them in a moment.<br/>
        If you do not yet have a movable.sed or your game's .bin file, you skipped something. Go back to <a
            href="index.html">the beginning.</a>
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <strong>UNDER DEVELOPMENT</strong> This section of the guide is under development and will change in the future.
        Currently, only instructions for the DIS are available, instructions on manually using <a
            href="https://github.com/zoogie/TADpole">TADpole</a> or <a
            href="https://github.com/knight-ryu12/Seedplanter/">SeedPlanter</a> will follow soonâ„¢
    </div>
    <h3>Section One - Using the DIS</h3>
    <p>
        Luckily for you, someone recently made a Service to make the next step a lot easier and possible without someone
        else sharing their private files with you.<br/>
        This service is the <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/dis-dsihax-injection-service.496072"><strong>DSiWare
        Injection Service</strong></a>, which we will now use to patch your game. If the site is down for whatever
        reason, you may still be able to use TADPole and inject the file yourself, use google if that's the case.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open <a href="https://jenkins.nelthorya.net/job/DSIHaxInjector/">this website</a></li>
        <li>Click <code>Build with Parameters</code> on the left side</li>
        <li>Enter your name in the Username Field - <strong>Any name will work</strong>, just dont make it too short or
            include spaces.
        </li>
        <li>Select the region you purchased your DSiWare Game in</li>
        <li>Upload the .bin file you previously got and saved to your Desktop in the <code>DsiBin</code> field</li>
        <li>Upload your <code>movable.sed</code> in the <code>MovableSed</code> field</li>
        <li>Click Build</li>
        <li>Wait a few seconds</li>
        <li>Click the new Build that popped up on the left side. You should see a file downloadable with your name at
            the end
        </li>
        <li>Download this file</li>
        <li>Rename it by removing the <code>.patched_yourname</code> part, so it ends in .bin - for example, it should
            be named <code>4B513956.bin</code> now
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Section Two - Re-Import the Game</h3>
    <p>
        You should now have a fully patched .bin file - great!<br/>
        We will now Re-Import the game to your 3DS's System Memory.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Power off your 3DS if you haven't already</li>
        <li>Put your SD Card into your PC</li>
        <li>Open the SD Card's Contents</li>
        <li>Open the Folder Named <code>Nintendo 3DS</code></li>
        <li>Open the Folder Named like your ID0</li>
        <li>Open its sub-folder, it has a 32-character-long name again</li>
        <li>Open the Folder Named <code>Nintendo DSiWare</code></li>
        <li>Copy the patched .bin file you downloaded and renamed into this folder, <strong>overwriting</strong> the
            file that is already there.
        </li>
        <li>Put the SD Card back into your 3DS</li>
        <li>Start your 3DS</li>
        <li>Open System Settings</li>
        <li>Open Data Management (Green option in the bottom right)</li>
        <li>Open DSi Ware</li>
        <li>Tap SD Card</li>
        <li>Tap Your Game</li>
        <li>Tap Copy</li>
        <li>you will be asked if you want to override the already existing copy - Tap Yes</li>
        <li>Wait for it to copy</li>
        <li>Exist System Settings</li>
        <li>Start your Game.<br/>
            You should be greeted by a white screen complaining that it could not load a file. <strong>this is the
                intended result.</strong><br/>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> if you used SUDOKU, you may need to tap the touchscreen so the Game loads the
            modified save file
            <div class="alert alert-danger">
                If you just get the game or sudoku, you have done something wrong and should start back at <strong>Section
                One</strong> above.
            </div>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Section Three - Preparing your SD Card</h3>
    <p>
        We now have an entry-point Exploit. Awesome! We will now start downloading some things to install a few tools
        and the actual Custom Firmware.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/releases/latest"> latest Version of Luma3DS
            (Currently 9.0)</a></li>
        <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/zoogie/b9sTool/releases">latest Version of this fork of b9sTool</a>
        </li>
        <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases">latest Version of Boot9Strap</a> (NOT
            the devkit, NOT the ntr version.)
        </li>
        <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases"> latest Version of the Homebrew Menu</a>
        </li>
        <li>Copy the <code>boot.firm</code> from the Luma3DS 7z archive to the root of your SD Card</li>
        <li>Copy the <code>boot.3dsx</code> (Homebrew Menu) to the root of your SD Card</li>
        <li>Copy the <code>boot.nds</code> from the b9stool archive to the root of your SD Card</li>
        <li>Copy the <code>boot9strap.firm</code> from the <code>boot9strap.zip</code> file to the
            <code>/boot9strap/</code> folder on your SD Card. (Create it if it does not exist)
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
