    <h1>Marenthyu's Guide to Custom Firmware using SeedMiner</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Required Reading</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome! You have come here, i guess, on the prospect of installing custom Firmware on your (new) Nintendo 3DS
        using the single-System Nintendo DSiWare Injection; Meaning you do <strong>not</strong> have:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>a friend with Custom Firmware willing to transfer their CFW to your device</li>
        <li>a supported Flashcard</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>and</strong> are on Firmware Version 11.4 or newer. (The newest one currently being 11.6.0)
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <strong>WARNING!</strong> This guide is only tested on 11.4 through 11.6 - <strong>if you are on a newer version
        and see this warning, i take no responsibility for your Device bricking as the used tools are only confirmed
        working with 11.6</strong> (at the time of writing this)
    </div>

    <p>
        If you <strong>do have any of the above</strong> and or <strong>are not on 11.4 through 11.6</strong>, please head over to <a
            href="https://3ds.hacks.guide">3ds.hacks.guide</a>
        and follow it, especially if you are on an earlier Version, as there are WAY faster methods for older versions
        which are extremely well documented.
    </p>
    <p>
        This guide will, at all times, attempt to be as thorough as possible, but i can not guarantee it to be
        understandable 100% of the time. If you have a question and/or don't understand something, don't hesitate to
        ask.
        <br/>

        That being said, i assume you are familiar with at least some degree of terminology regarding Custom Firmware
        and have read <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide">this main page</a> and
        <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/get-started">this getting started page.</a>

        your
