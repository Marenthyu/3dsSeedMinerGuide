    <h1>Marenthyu's Guide to Custom Firmware using SeedMiner</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Required Reading</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome! You have come here, i guess, on the prospect of installing custom Firmware on your (new) Nintendo 3DS
        using the single-System Nintendo DSiWare Injection; Meaning you do <strong>not</strong> have:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>a friend with Custom Firmware willing to transfer their CFW to your device</li>
        <li>a supported Flashcard</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>and</strong> are on Firmware Version 11.4 or newer. (The newest one currently being 11.6.0)
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <strong>WARNING!</strong> This guide is only tested on 11.4 through 11.6 - <strong>if you are on a newer version
        and see this warning, i take no responsibility for your Device bricking as the used tools are only confirmed
        working with 11.6</strong> (at the time of writing this)
    </div>

    <p>
        If you <strong>do have any of the above</strong> and or <strong>are not on 11.4 through 11.6</strong>, please
        head over to <a
            href="https://3ds.hacks.guide">3ds.hacks.guide</a>
        and follow it, especially if you are on an earlier Version, as there are WAY faster methods for older versions
        which are extremely well documented.

            <h3>What is SeedMiner?</h3>
            <p>
                SeedMiner is a tool that allows you to brute-force a console-unique Key. It utilises your Graphics
                Card's
                amazing processing power to try out all possible combinations, with one of them being guaranteed to
                work.
                <br/>
                Using this key (or "seed"), it is possible to then sign a DSiWare Game which has been modified to run an
                exploit on your Device when launching it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This all is only possible thanks to a flaw in the key calculation, which makes it (almost) predictable -
                more
                information on the nitty-gritty details can be found on
                <a href="https://zoogie.github.io/web/34%E2%85%95c3/#/">zoogie's explanation slide here</a>, but long
                story short:
                using your LCFS (<strong>L</strong>ocal <strong>F</strong>riend-<strong>C</strong>ode <strong>S</strong>eed),
                it is possible to predict your <code>movable.sed</code> key with an accuracy of about +-4000, which we
                then can "easily" brute-force.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to getting everything you will need to get your <code>movable.sed</code>, this guide will
                also
                recommend you a few tools which you can then use to actually inject your modified Game/Save onto your
                console.
                <br/>
                In most cases, you will be able to use an automated service, but if that fails you, you may need to try
                one of the other tools available to you.

        This guide will, at all times, attempt to be as thorough as possible, but i can not guarantee it to be
        understandable 100% of the time. If you have a question and/or don't understand something, don't hesitate to
        ask.

        and have read <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide">this main page</a> and
