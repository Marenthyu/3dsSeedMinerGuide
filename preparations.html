        <h3>Section One - Sanity check</h3>
        <p>
            First things first.
            <br/>
            We will now check if you had CFW installed before.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Power off your Nintendo 3DS</li>
            <li>Hold the <code>SELECT</code> Button and turn on your 3DS. Don't let go until you see the Home Menu or Luma</li>
            <li>You should see the Home Menu.<br/><div class="alert alert-danger">
                <strong>If you see the Luma Configuration screen, STOP HERE.</strong>
                <br/>This means you already have or had CFW installed. Please ask on the <a href="https://discord.gg/C29hYvh">Homebrew Discord</a> for help, clearly stating your issue.
            </div></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Section Two - DSiWare Game</h3>
        <p>
            No CFW existing? Good!<br/>Let's get a game.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Check <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/installing-boot9strap-(dsiware-game-injection-list)">this website</a> if you already have any of the listed Games. If you do, great, continue on with <a href="#section3">Section Three - Dumping Your Game</a>
                <ul><li>Additionally, it also works with any of the following games:</li>
                    <li>“Fieldrunners”</li>
                    <li>
                    “Legends of Exidia”</li>
                    <li>
                    “Guitar Rock Tour”</li>
                    <li>
                        “The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords”</li></ul></li>
                <li>You need to legitimately own one of the listed games on the device you want to install CFW on. <strong>Pirated copies won't work.</strong><br/>
                </li>
                <li>Open the eShop (update your device if necessary)</li>
                <li>Open the Menu</li>
                <li>Go to Settings and more</li>
                <li>Go to Scan QR Code</li>
                <li>Scan any QR Code from <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/installing-boot9strap-(dsiware-game-injection-list)">the website linked above</a>, making sure it is a game form your region.
                <br/>
                I recommend SUDOKU by EA, as it is just 2$ and the game this exploit was originally discovered in</li>
                <li>Buy the game</li>
                <li>Download the game</li>

            </ol>

        <h3>Section Three - Dumping Your Game</h3>
        <p>Got a game? Let's grab it.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open System Settings on your 3DS</li>
            <li>Open Data Management (Green option in the bottom right)</li>
            <li>Open DSi Ware</li>
            <li>Under System Memory, tap your game</li>
            <li>Tap Copy</li>
            <li>You will be asked if you are sure to copy it as it will make the game unplayable - Tap Yes</li>
            <li>Exit out of System Settings and Power off your 3DS</li>
        </ol>

    </div>
    <div>
        <a name="section4"></a>
        <h3>Section Four - Finding your correct ID0</h3>
        <p>
            We will need your ID0, which is a unique String to identify your console.<br/>
            To get it, please do the following:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Power off your 3DS if you haven't already</li>
                <li>Put your SD Card into your PC</li>
                <li>Open the SD Card's Contents</li>
                <li>Open the Folder Named <code>Nintendo 3DS</code></li>
                <li>You will now find one or multiple folders with 32-character-long names.<br/>
                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                        If you only have one, that's good! Continue with step 15
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Navigate one folder up so you can see the <code>Nintendo 3DS</code> folder again</li>
                <li>Rename your <code>Nintendo 3DS</code> folder to <code>Nintendo 3DSORIGINALDONOTDELETEME</code> by right-clicking it and selecting Rename...</li>
                <li>Put the SD Card back into your 3DS</li>
                <li>Power on your Nintendo 3DS</li>
                <li><strong>Wait</strong> for it to generate its data on your SD Card</li>
                <li>Power off your 3DS</li>
                <li>Insert the SD Card into your PC</li>
                <li>Open the SD Card's Contents</li>
                <li>Open the Folder Named <code>Nintendo 3DS</code></li>
                <li>You should now see one Folder with a 32-character-long name. Write its name down, preferably copy it somewhere. (Where doesn't matter as long as you remember it.)<br/>
                    <div class="alert alert-info">This name of the folder is your <strong>ID0</strong> - There is another one inside of it, but you can safely ignore it for now.</div></li>
                <li>If you did <strong>NOT</strong> skip from step 5 to step 15, delete the <code>Nintendo 3DS</code> folder and rename the <code>Nintendo 3DSORIGINALDONOTDELETEME</code> folder back to <code>Nintendo 3DS</code></li>

            </ol>
        <p>
            Remember your ID0. You will need it later.
        </p>
    </div>

        <h3>Section Five - Copying your dsiware.bin file</h3>
        <p>
            You got your ID0 and bought the game which has been dumped to your SD Card. You will now need to find said dump.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Power off your 3DS if you haven't already</li>
                <li>Put your SD Card into your PC</li>
                <li>Open the SD Card's Contents</li>
                <li>Open the Folder Named <code>Nintendo 3DS</code></li>
                <li>Open the Folder Named like your ID0</li>
                <li>Open its sub-folder, it has a 32-character-long name again</li>
                <li>Open the Folder Named <code>Nintendo DSiWare</code></li>
                <li>You will find one or more .bin files. If you have multiples, go back to the website from Section Two and find the ID of the game you bought.<br/>
                    Copy the .bin file somewhere you can remember. For example, your desktop. To do so, click the file and press CTRL/STRG/CMD and C, then go to your Desktop and press CTRL/STRG/CMD and V.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <p>
            If you have followed everything correctly, you now know your ID0 and have your game dumped as a .bin file.<br/>
        </p>
